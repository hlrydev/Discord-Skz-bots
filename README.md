# Discord Bots Collection: Quokkabot, Llamabot & Chickbot

A trio of funny, interactive Python-based Discord bots inspired by Stray Kids members. Each bot captures the personality and charm of Han, Hyunjin, and Felix through their animal-themed personas, designed to engage users through various commands, games, and entertainment features.

## The Bots

### Quokkabot (Han)
The energetic, witty bot reflecting Han's humor and rap skills with a cheerful quokka personality.

### Llamabot (Hyunjin)  
The artistic, dramatic bot capturing Hyunjin's creative and expressive nature with llama quirks.

### Chickbot (Felix)
The sunshine bot with Felix's warm, cheerful personality and deep voice charm in chicken form.

## Features

## IMPORTANT NOTE

*This project dates back to 2021 and represents an exploration of Python programming and Discord bot development. While I'm not actively working with Python currently, I can explain the core logic and concepts implemented in these bots. The project demonstrates understanding of event-driven programming, API integration, and user interaction design.*
